1. WHERE (Filtering Data)
Explanation: Acts as a filter. It tells the database to only return rows that meet a specific condition.

Syntax: WHERE [Column] [Operator] [Value]
## CODE
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE Department = 'Sales';

SELECT * FROM Products 
WHERE Price >= 100;

Operators: =, <> (Not equal), >, <, LIKE, IN.

2.ORDER BY (Sorting Data)
Explanation: Sorts the results. By default, it sorts Ascending (low to high). Use DESC for Descending (high to low).

ASC: 1 to 10, A to Z (Default).

DESC: 10 to 1, Z to A.

SQL
-- Sort by price (Lowest to Highest)
SELECT * FROM Products 
ORDER BY Price ASC;

-- Sort by date (Newest First)
SELECT * FROM Orders 
ORDER BY OrderDate DESC;

3.LIMIT (Restricting Rows)
Explanation: Limits the number of rows returned. Essential for performance and "Top 10" style reports.

Note: Use TOP if you are using SQL Server; use LIMIT for MySQL/PostgreSQL.

SQL
-- Get the first 5 rows only
SELECT * FROM Customers 
LIMIT 5;

-- Combine with ORDER BY to get the "Top 3 most expensive items"
SELECT ProductName, Price 
FROM Products 
ORDER BY Price DESC 
LIMIT 3;
